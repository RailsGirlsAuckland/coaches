Presenter set up
================

Vend offices run a staff and guest network set up. 
The main screen (boardroom) projector, runs via Apple TV. If you're presenting, you'll have received a WiFi code for the staff network.

Our AV guy, Rob, will be on hand to help. He'll have a box of adapters too.
