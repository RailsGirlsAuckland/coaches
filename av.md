Presenter set up
================

Vend offices run a staff and guest network set up. 
The main screen (boardroom) projector, runs via Apple TV. (can we plug straight into projector?)
To connect to the ATV, you need to air play from the staff network. We will have a spare staff network login for presenters to use in rotation. Otherwise, a staff laptop will be available for you to use. If you'll need to use this, please ensure you've sent through your slides to railsgirlsauckland@gmail.com by Wednesday 2 June.

Saturday afternoon streams:

- In the boardroom, we'll have the HTML/CSS stream.
- In the main kitchen area, we'll have the TDD/Ruby stream. Mal's laptop can connect to the screen in the kitchen area.
