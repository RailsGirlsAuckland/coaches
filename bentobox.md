Bentobox exercise
==============

Necessary resources:

- Bentobox exercise sheet
- Post-its
- Pen

The goal of the Bentobox exercise is to give context to technological terms and concepts, e.g. MySQL is a database management system and is used to store data. The name for this exercise originates from the Japanese lunchbox (Bentobox), a boxed lunch where every component is put into its right place to make up a well-balanced meal.

We will give a quick presentation about the exercise for everyone and go through examples. You will then split into your groups and try to help your group to place 10 terms one at a time into the right category. (We will provide you with a solution for this ;)) 

When going through the terms, ask the participants where they would place the term before revealing the solution. Also, try to explain the terms when going through them. If you have finished placing all 10, you could ask your group if there are any other word they heard of, but not know where to place them.
