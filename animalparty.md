Coach Directions
===========

You'll be added to the Rails Girls Auckland repo. 

Each team has a section in the main Animal Party repo, and a branch set up for them to collate their changes before merging into the main branch.

You need to work with your teams to create an animal-GIF story. All of your team should contribute at least one GIF to the story. 

We want the students to learn about forking, pull requests, and avoiding merge conflicts! You need to make sure all contributions are between the start and end tags for your group.

When you've got a contribution from all students, send a pull request to the master repo.
